Weather App

A weather app that shows weather conditions now and a 5 day forecast for the user's current location or for a location that is searched.

The weather app wireframe was done using https://www.invisionapp.com/. The app has been executed using HTML, Bootstrap, custom CSS and JavaScript. The weather data is called from two APIs at https://openweathermap.org/ (providing weather data for 200 000 cities). Temperature on the current weather info can be converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Images used on the app have been captured by myself in my lovely place of residence; Marbella, Spain.

The app has been done as a project for SheCodes Plus web development workshop https://www.shecodes.io/. It is hosted on Netlify https://www.netlify.com/.
